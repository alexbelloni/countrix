# Countrix 
  
## Introduction
Countrix is an educational platform, which presents information about all countries such as its flag, population, and capital city. There are two options of searching: by name or region. The click on a country brings more details about it.

## Challenge
This project is based on a FrontMentor [challenge](bit.ly/3ikC9I1), which allows the developer to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.  
The challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.  

## Requeriments
Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## Main technologies
- Reactjs with routes 
- Styled-Components  
- Hooks - such as useQuery and useState  

## Next Steps
It's a work in progress. When praticing or reviewing a tech subject, I'll apply here.  
- Google Maps  
- Acessibility
